# ImageBlur Chrome Extension
This plugin blurs out images in <img> tags on the current web page. If you hover over an image for 1 second, the image will be revealed. Features include: blur/unblur images by default, a blur images button, and an "unblur" images button.

### Featues I would like to add:
I anticipate adding a better icon, functionality to blur background images, "right-click" option to unblur or blur a specific images on a page and the ability to whitelist and blacklist specific pages/sites.
